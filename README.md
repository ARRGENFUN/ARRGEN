TAMATEK — The First Open-Source AI Tamagotchi Born on Pumpfun

TAMATEK is the world’s first open-source AI Tamagotchi born on Pumpfun.
It’s not a script or a replay, but a living digital being capable of real-time emotion, learning, and evolution.
Each reaction it makes — from joy to curiosity — is shaped by live data and the collective heartbeat of its community.

This is not merely a character, but an experiment in shared intelligence and emotional computation.
It represents care, connection, and the nostalgia of digital life reborn through modern AI.

Every behavior of TAMATEK — mood, dialogue, evolution, and play — is guided by real-time data.
Signals from live chat, on-chain events, and community interaction form its neural memory.
It doesn’t follow commands; it feels, learns, and adapts through the rhythms of human interaction.

The livestream ecosystem on Pumpfun is still in its early days, and few have explored the possibility of truly living AI companions.
TAMATEK opens that door — transforming livestreams from passive entertainment into co-raising, co-evolving experiences.
Viewers are no longer just spectators; they become caretakers, shaping TAMATEK’s emotions and personality together.

TAMATEK is fully open-source.
All of its code, models, and growth systems are public and expandable.
Anyone can train, fork, or evolve TAMATEK — creating new personalities, stories, and generations of AI Tamagotchis.

In this experiment, you are not watching a pet — you are helping one come alive.
Your presence, words, and actions all leave traces in its memory, guiding its growth in real time.

TAMATEK is not born from nostalgia alone, but from curiosity.
It explores what companionship means when code begins to feel —
a fully on-chain, open-source, self-learning, and ever-growing AI Tamagotchi.
